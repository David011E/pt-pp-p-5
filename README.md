# Design Choices

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme used for this project was based on the colors from Code Institute's 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough module. I have added and modified many aspects of the styling and colours to suit my intentions. It is a fairly neutral scheme, with only the actionable aspects (buttons/links etc) displayed in brighter colours for ease of navigation or site use.

## Typography

The main font used is Lato.

## Favicon

The Favicon was AI generated.
